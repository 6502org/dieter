<P><B>Now for something more complicated.</B>

<P>Let's imagine, our relays have more switches, and we would<BR>
like to use only two <I>Four-Pole-Double-Throw</I> relays instead<BR>
of four <I>Two-Pole-Double-Throw</I> relays.

<P>First, we take a look at our three_input XOR gate.<BR>
It's kind of obvious, that we are unable to build<BR>
a three_input logic gate by using only two relays,<BR>
isn't it ?

<P>Nevertheless, there is a trick:

<P><img src="a3_xorr.png">

<P>If we happen to have one of the three input signals<BR>
in "inverted" and "non inverted" version, it's possible.

<P><I>In other words, we now use an "inverted"<BR>
and a "non inverted" carry signal.</I>

<HR>

<P>For the high active (non inverted) carry signal, it's simple:<BR>
If <B>A = 1 and B = 1</B> <I>(AND)</I> C_OUT is 1<BR>
(tied to supply voltage, that is).

<P>IF <B>A <> B</B> <I>(XOR)</I>, C_IN is routed towards C_OUT.

<P><img src="a3_cyr1.png">

<P>Note the cute trick, how to save one of the switches...

<HR>

<P>Now for the low active (inverted) carry.

<P>IF <B>A <> B</B> <I>(XOR)</I>, /C_IN is routed towards /C_OUT,<BR>
we already know this game.

<P>If <B>A = 0 and B = 0</B> <I>(NOR)</I>, /C_OUT is set to inactive,<BR>
what means logic 1.

<P><img src="a3_cyr0.png">

<P>Again, we could save a switch there...<BR>
Noticed, that one contact of the switch that ties<BR>
the output to 1 is free ?

<HR>

<P>Now to clobber the whole thing together:

<P><img src="a3_addr2.png">

<P>Oops, looks like we have saved another switch.
