<P>Now for something different: a decoder.

<P><img src="a3_decode.png">

<P>A, B select one output (Q0, Q1, Q2 Q3) to be routed to the supply voltage...

<P>Of course, it doesn't have to be the supply voltage.<BR>
It also could be an "enable signal", a little bit like with the 74139.

<P>By the way, it's possible to tie some of the outputs together:

<P><img src="a3_multi.png">

<P>Looks like it's possible to use this in our four relay adder,<BR>
so we could save one switch...<BR>
maybe for integrating a register (ACC) into the ALU.


<P>Another idea would be, to use a 4:1 multiplexer which connects<BR>
to the adder output, and the logic functions NOR, XOR, AND.<BR>
This might take 6 (Two-Pole-Double-Switch) relays per Bit,<BR>
and maybe some additional relays for inverting the ALU B input<BR>
(for A-B), and for forcing B to 0 or -1 (for incrementing/decrementing A).

<P>There is a more efficient approach, it shows up at the next page...<BR>

<HR>

<P>Another thing is, that we could turn the "pyramid" of relay switches<BR>
"upside down", so that it routes one of four inputs to one output.<BR>
In other words, we are building a multiplexer,<BR>
a little bit like with the 74153.

<HR>

<P><B>Speaking of switches...</B><BR>
Left to right:

<P>
Relay <B>switch</B> from the stone age,<BR>
bipolar differential emitter coupled <B>current switch</B>,<BR>
<B>differential Current switch</B> with FETs ...as used in Pentium 4.

<P><img src="a3_switch.png">

<P>Of course, when technology changes, design rules also change...<BR>
I'm leaving out quite a few details.

<P>...the <I>"automatic Digital Computation symposium 1953"</I><BR>
(available at Bitsavers) gives you a few hints about how to<BR>
do such things with vacuum tubes,<BR>
take a look at the MOSAIC computer.

<HR>

<P>Nevertheless:

<P><img src="a3_multi2.png">

<P>Taking a look at the "pyramid" of switches while comparing relay<BR>
switches with differential transistor pairs leads to interesting results.
