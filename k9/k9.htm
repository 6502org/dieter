<P><CENTER>This page is about the K9 chassis,<BR>
which was part of some old Philips TVs,<BR>
not about dogs and such.</CENTER>

<P><CENTER><I>Most of the tinkering<BR>
did happen in 1995.</I></CENTER>

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="k9_innards.jpg">

<P>Many years ago, elektronics hobbyists did like to play<BR>
with the K9 chassis, because it was nice and service<BR>
friendly, and every TV came together with a neat,<BR>
colored set of schematics.

<P>At some point, people did start to throw away their<BR>
old TVs, and I did salvage plenty of spare parts<BR>
from scrap, for being able to repair my old TV at home.

<HR>

<P>As the mains switch went defective, I started to<BR>
wonder if it would be possible to replace it by a<BR>
more reliable solution.

<P>First, I did replace the switch with a "pushbutton"<BR>
like those used in control cabinets...


<P><IMG SRC="k9_switch.jpg">

<P><I>(The brown thing at the left side of the picture.)</I>

<P>It triggered an "Eltako", as used in staircase<BR>
illuminations, which turned on/off a neat contactor<BR>
(at the right side of the picture).

<P><IMG SRC="k9_contactor.jpg">

<P>Note the PCB material below the contactor:<BR>
A homebuilt "silencer" to prevent the casing of<BR>
the TV from humming at 50 Hz.

<P>Two switches 16A were wired in parallel, to make<BR>
the contactor live longer than than the rest of the TV.

<HR>

<P>Unfortunately the TV did have sensor buttons to change<BR>
the cannels, things that sense the impedance of the<BR>
tip of your finger... and after two decades of operation,<BR>
cleaning solvent didn't help anymore to keep them<BR>
working.

<P>Also, the Nixie tube in the display did fail to show<BR>
all of the numbers, so I did decide to build something<BR>
more reliable.

<P><IMG SRC="k9_keys.jpg">
<P><IMG SRC="k9_receiver.jpg">

<P>Middle: precision DIP socket, holding a 7 segment display.<BR>
Right: receiver for an IR remote control...

<P>The ICs related to said sensors also did show some<BR>
signs of oxidation/corrosion, so I just did replace that<BR>
part of the circuitry with some CMOS logic ICs from<BR>
the drawer.

<P>Some Schmitt triggers, a priority encoder, a latch,<BR>
then a decoder and some transistors to drive the reed<BR>
relays (not shown in this picture), which sent different<BR>
voltages to the tuner.

<P><IMG SRC="k9_select.jpg">

<P>Did have no 7 segment decoder/driver IC in the drawer,<BR>
so I did use a handful 1N4148 diodes instead.

<HR>

<P>Now for the next modification:<BR>
The ultrasonic remote control of the TV went<BR>
defective, maybe because of leaking battery acid...

<P>Buying a replacement for the remote control did turn<BR>
out to be very expensive, so I did decide to build my<BR>
very own IR remote control.

<P>Ok, so it won't win a price for beauty, on the other<BR>
hand it won't be impressed when getting thrown at a<BR>
brick wall.

<P><IMG SRC="k9_remote.jpg">

<P>Some years later, I did find an original ultrasonic<BR>
remote control in the dumpster, so it was possible<BR>
to control the TV by IR and ultrasonic at the same<BR>
time...

<P>Problem was, the TV did have no microcontroller at all,<BR>
and for some reasons I wanted to keep it that way.

<P><IMG SRC="k9_brains.jpg">

<P>Right side: original Philips ultrasonic control<BR>
circuitry. The metal box did have a sign on it:<BR>
<I>"If the TV happens to do anything strange, replace<BR>
the whole box with another box from the factory.<BR>
<B>Thou shalt not try to repair it by yourself."</B></I>

<P>As a hobbyist, you can't resist such labels.

<P><IMG SRC="k9_control.jpg">

<P>Figured out, that they did use 74xx up/down counters<BR>
with DACs built from simple resistor networks to set<BR>
volume, brightness and such.

<P>And I happen to know, what to do with 74xx ICs...

<P>Now to take a look into my IR decoder:

<P><IMG SRC="k9_decoder.jpg">

<P>Basically a SAA3009, connected to some decoders,<BR>
which did drive 74LS06 ICs, connected to the wires<BR>
which tapped into the original ultrasonic control<BR>
circuitry.

<P><B>Don't try such things at home, kids.</B>

<P>(If I wouldn't have had some SAA3006/SAA3009 ICs<BR>
in the drawer, I would have tried something different,<BR>
just don't ask...)

<HR>

<P>At some point, I did want to have a standby<BR>
mode, so I did a few more modifications.

<P><IMG SRC="k9_power.jpg">

<P>Here the switchmode power supply, with a cable<BR>
which wasn't intended to be there by the manufacturer.

<P><IMG SRC="k9_standby.jpg">

<P>And a transformer with a 9V output, which powered<BR>
the control circuitry during standby.

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="k9_defective.jpg">

<P>But in the end, it did feel too much like riding a<BR>
dead horse.<BR>
As it went defective again, I didn't want to fix it<BR> 
anymore, so the TV went scrapped back in 2007.

<P>I somehow doubt, that you have a chance to keep<BR>
nowadays modern TVs up and running for more than<BR>
30 years as a mere electronics hobbyist...

<P><I>After the K9 went out of production, Philips did<BR>
build a chassis which somehow did look like<BR>
engineered by evil space aliens.</I>

<HR>

<P>Well, I still happen to have a Grundig TV<BR>
from 1988, but that's another story.<BR>
I only had to repair it two times... yet.
