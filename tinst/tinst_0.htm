| Joke: an airplane prototype sometimes unexpectedly     |
| falls from the sky.                                    |
| The machine engineers were able to locate/identify     |
| the problem:                                           |
|                                                        |
| the trouble was caused by a part known to scientists   |
| for 30 years, but it was the first time that someone   |
| really _built_ it.                                     |
| It turned out, that the scientist simulating it for    |
| the very first time did something wrong with an        |
| exponent, and all the future generations of scientists |
| to come just used copy and paste.                      |
|                                                        |
| In the atmosphere/gravity of Jupiter,                  |
| this part would have worked perfectly.                 |
|                                                        |
| ...nevertheless, I really wish I would have simulated  |
| this CPU before building it.                           |
