<P>Uart clock has to be 16 times faster than the Baud Rate.

<P>For instance, 19.2 kBaud would require that CLK = 307.2 kHz.

<P>Divider factors for some common crystal/oscillator frequencies:<BR>
<PRE>
 18.4320 MHz -> : 60
 11.0592 MHz -> : 36
  9.8304 MHz -> : 32
  9.2160 MHz -> : 30
  7.3728 MHz -> : 24
  6.1440 MHz -> : 20
<B>  4.9152 MHz -> : 16 </B>
<B>  3.6864 MHz -> : 12 </B>
  2.4576 MHz -> :  8
  1.8432 MHz -> :  6
</PRE>

<P>And if the application doesn't require to _exactly_ match the Baud Rate,<BR>
there might be some other interesting frequencies...

<P>4 MHz divided by 13 gives 307.6923 kHz, what is ca. 0.16% off from 307.2
kHz.

<P>Note: The UART clock doesn't need to have a 50% duty cycle...

<HR>

<P>Example for using a 3.6864 MHz TTL oscillator:

<HR>

<P>It's also possible to build an 8 Bit programmable divider with two
74163.

<P>Another approach would be tapping with a 74151 multiplexer into the<BR>
outputs of a 74393, if only a few different Baud Rates are needed.

<P>The most primitive approach is using a jumper to select the Baud Rate,<BR>
as shown in the example above.

<P>Also note, that there are a few examples in the Internet about how to<BR>
configurate the Baud Rate of UARTs that are integrated into Microcontrollers...<BR>
PICs, for instance.
