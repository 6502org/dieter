<P>First, we are starting with a simple half adder circuit<BR>
from the school books.

<P>It uses a 7408 AND gate, and a 7486 XOR gate.

<P>Q = A + B, and the (high active) carry output<BR>
turns to 1, if A = 1 and B = 1.

<P><IMG SRC="a5_ha1.png">

<P>If you only happen to have 7400 NAND gates,<BR>
there is another approach which is mentioned<BR>
less often in those school books:

<P><IMG SRC="a5_ha2.png">

<P>Downside is, that the carry output of this schematic<BR>
is low active, means that A = 1 and B = 1 turns the<BR>
carry output to 0.

<HR>

<P>For building a full adder, we need two half adders:

<P>The 7400 NAND approach:

<P><IMG SRC="a5_fa2.png">

<P>Note, that if you take a NAND gate and invert both<BR>
intput, it turns into an OR gate.<BR>
And that's why the carry output of this full adder<BR>
is high active.

<P><I>"Why is that guy warming up old boring basics again ?"</I>,<BR>
You may ask now.

<P>Ok, to make things a bit more difficult to understand,<BR>
we now build a half adder with 7410 three_input NANDs:

<P>Note the blue marked control signals T, X, Y and S.

<P>Then stare for a while at this picture above,<BR>
think about the implications,<BR>
and then go for the next page of this article.
