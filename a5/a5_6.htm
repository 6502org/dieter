<P>The MC10800 was a 4 Bit ECL ALU slice from Motorola.<BR>
The architecture was completely different from the<BR>
MC2901/MC2903 (or AM2901/AM2903).

<P>The MC10800 had only an accumulator instead of the<BR>
16 registers in the MC2901/MC2903, but it supported<BR>
BCD arithmetic.

<P>Since the MC10800 is very different from everything<BR>
I have seen so far, I felt the need to describe a very<BR>
simplified model of what it does in binary mode<BR>
(without BCD, that is).

<P><I>Since I'm unable to verify, what happens inside a real<BR>
MC10800, please don't take the rest of this article<BR>
too serious. You better stick with the datasheet, sorry.</I>
