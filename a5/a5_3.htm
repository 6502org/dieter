<P>The 7480 was a one Bit binary full adder.<BR>
A similar device with identical pinout and functionality<BR>
was the Signetics 8268.

<P><IMG SRC="a5_7480.png">

<P>It sure looks a bit odd, especially the low_active<BR>
carry output.<BR>
Also note the inverted and non_inverted sum outputs<BR>
Q and /Q.

<P>Depending on how we connect those funny NAND<BR>
gates at the A,B inputs, it is possible to configurate<BR>
the adder inputs to be high_ or low_active.<BR>
(inverted or non_inverted, that is).

<P>There is a reason for all this, but we are discussing<BR>
that later. Now for the two different input configurations:

<P><IMG SRC="a5_7480nb.png">
<P><IMG SRC="a5_7480b.png">

<P>(Same thing for the A input.)

<P>The first NAND (fed from B1, B2) is an open collector<BR>
type (like 7401), and the Signetics datasheet mentions<BR>
that the pullup resistor at the NAND output is 4.3 kOhm.

<P>Now to take a look at the circuitry inside the adder box:

<P><IMG SRC="a5_7480l.png">

<P>And when taking a closer look to the truth table<BR>
of the adder, it turns out that our adder also works<BR>
well if we change polarity of all the input/output<BR>
signals.

<P>Two Bit adder example with inverted and non_inverted<BR>
carry signal. Note the /C1 signal:

<P><IMG SRC="a5_7480c.png">

<P>Side note:<BR>
The Bit_serial EDUC8 computer used the 7480 and some logic<BR>
gates as ALU, but for best performance I would recommend<BR>
taking two 74151 multiplexers as ALU for building Bit_serial<BR>
machines... like described in "ALU design Part 3, CM-1".

<P>The first implementations of the 7483 four Bit adder contained<BR>
four 7480_like full adders.<BR>
Later versions of the 7483 started to use a fast lookahead carry...<BR>
until the 7483 eventually went obsolete by the invention of the<BR>
74283.
