| When Till Eulenspiegel did take a job at a bakery, |
| he asked his new boss:                             |
| "What am I supposed to bake ?"                     |
| "Owls and long tailed monkeys, of course",         |
| came the gruff/impatient/sarcastic reply.          |
| So Till did.                                       |
| The oddly shaped cookies became a big success...   |
| after Till went fired, of course.                  |

<P><B>Warning: the things in this article are untested.</B>

<P>Don't expect anything to work as intended.

<P>You may want to do some experimenting on your own...<BR>
and to write some articles about it.

<P>The source of some of those ideas were the schematics<BR>
of the Imlac PDS-1 computer (avaliable at Bitsavers).

<P>When digging into said schematics, don't get confused<BR>
by such things as labeling the MSB as Bit 0 and the LSB<BR>
as Bit 15 on a 16 Bit databus.

<P>Always be aware, that we are talking about the <B>PDS-1</B><BR>
in this article, which used an ALU based on JK flipflops.<BR>
<I>The <B>PDS-1D</B> ALU was 74181 based, don't mix this up.</I>

<P>Also, things in the schematics certainly won't look<BR>
as nice, simple and obvious (at least I hope so) as<BR>
the things described in this article.

<P>I don't claim to fully understand the Imlac,<BR>
and I'm not trying to rebuild some part of it.<BR>
You are on your own.

<P>Good luck.
