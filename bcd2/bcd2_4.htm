<P>The 74583 was a 4 Bit BCD adder from TI.<BR>
Here a picture from the datasheet:

<P>The 74582 was a 4 Bit BCD adder/subtractor,<BR>
and the 9s complement circuitry at the B inputs<BR>
already was mentioned at page 2 of this article.

<P>Obviously, the people who did draw the 74582 schematic<BR>
were in a hurry, so don't expect every connection in said<BR>
schematic to be correct.

<P>Since the 74582 seems to use the same adder circuitry<BR>
as the 74583, I decided to show schematics for both ICs...<BR>
and to let the readers with too much spare time at their hands<BR>
sort out the differences.
