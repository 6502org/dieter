<P>The 100181 ALU (National Semiconductor)<BR>
was a 4 Bit ALU which featured BCD arithmetic.<BR>
It was ECL, and very different from the 74181.

<P>Unfortunately, the datasheet doesn't go deep enough<BR>
into the details of the innards of this IC for my taste.

<HR>

<P>Spent some thoughts about how BCD addition/subtraction<BR>
is handled inside this IC, and I don't know if they are correct.

<P>Here we go.

<P>For BCD A+B, the IC adds +6 to B.<BR>
So Q=A +B+6.

<P>Means, if A+B is greater than 9, the adder output<BR>
A+B+6 is greater than (or equal to) hexadecimal 0x10...<BR>
what means that the adder output is a valid 4 Bit BCD number,<BR>
and that no BCD correction is necessary.

<P>Downside is, that if A+B is 0..9,<BR>
A+B+6 is 6..15, and in that case we have to subtract 6<BR>
to turn the adder output into a valid result.

<HR>

<P>Now for Q=A-B.

<P><IMG SRC="bcd2_181_sub.png">

<P>C_IN now works as a low_active borrrow.

<P>Let's suppose, that A=9, B=0, C_IN=1.<BR>
B' is the 1s complement of B, means decimal 15.<BR>
Q=A+B'+C_IN, means Q=9+15+1.<BR>
So Q=25... or hexadecimal 0x19.<BR>
Means, the 4 Bit binary adder sets the low_active<BR>
borrow output to 1, and the adder output turns into 9...<BR>
a correct BCD result, so the multiplexer routes the<BR>
adder outputs directly to Q.

<P>Suppose, that A=1, B=2, C_IN=1.<BR>
Since B is 2 (binary 0010), B' is 13 (binary 1101).<BR>
Q=A+B+C_IN, means Q=1+13+1.<BR>
So Q=15, and the adder output carry C_OUT is 0.<BR>
The output multiplexer then places the -6 circuitry<BR>
between adder output and Q... and 15-6=9.<BR>
C_OUT=0, since we have a low_active borrow,<BR>
so Q is interpreted as -9.<BR>
It really works.

<HR>

<P>Actually, the 100181 datasheet might tell you a story<BR>
that in case of BCD Q=A-B, B is turned into a 9s complement<BR>
and then incremented by 6 for generating B'.

<P><IMG SRC="bcd2_181_compl.png">

<P>But for better readability, I decided to use the<BR>
1s complement in my example.
