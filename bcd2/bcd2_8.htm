<P>Excess 3 adder/subtractor:

<P><IMG SRC="bcd2_xas.png">

<P>Notation:<BR>
<B>A bold number</B> means 'as seen from a logic probe',<BR>
so <B>3</B> says that the bus lines have 0011 at hardware level.

<P>The adder on the right corrects the result<BR>
by adding or subtracting <B>3</B>,<BR>
according to the carry output C_OUT.


<P>Example:<BR>
BCD 0 + BCD 0  is BCD 0.<BR>
The Excess 3 code for BCD 0 is <B>3</B>.<BR>
So the adder in the middle of the picture<BR>
who does A+B' will say '<B>3</B>+<B>3</B>=<B>6</B>'.<BR>
C_OUT=0, so the second adder corrects<BR>
this result by subtracting <B>3</B> (by adding <B>13</B>),<BR>
and our Q outputs emit the correct value of <B>3</B>,<BR>
which means 0 when converting it<BR>
from Excess 3 back into BCD code.

<P><I>(Sorry, if hopping around between different<BR>
number systems confuses you.)</I>

<P>Another example:<BR>
BCD 9 + BCD 3 is BCD 12.<BR>
When representing those BCD codes in Excess 3,<BR>
what we are getting at hardware level is<BR>
<B>12</B> at A and <B>6</B> at A,<BR>
and the adder in the middle says A+B=<B>18</B>,<BR>
which means it passes on <B>2</B> to the second adder<BR>
and sets the C_OUT signal to 1.<BR>
So the second adder adds <B>3</B> to the result,<BR>
what sets the end result at Q to <B>5</B>.<BR>
What means 12 when converting C_OUT and Q<BR>
back into BCD code.

<P>Now for the little box which turns B into B'.

<P><IMG SRC="bcd2_xat.png">

<P>Like with binary adders in some ALU design articles,<BR>
the box turns B' to B, /B, 0, or -1.

<P>But because Excess 3 zero means binary <B>0011</B>,<BR>
things are a little bit more complicated.

<P>And if you really happen to have too much time on your hands,<BR>
please dig into the innards of old calculators,<BR>
and write some articles about your discoveries.

<P>When trying to build your own calculator,<BR>
dig for Digi-Cal by R.W. Coles,<BR>
Practical Electronics, February 1973<BR>
(available at Bitsavers).
