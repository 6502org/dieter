<P>A proof, that building an ALU with multiplexers really works.

<P>I'm now drawing things a bit different from the 74381/74382<BR>
datasheet, simplifying the one or other part.

<P><IMG SRC="a7_382_b.png">

<P>Basically we have a 4 Bit ALU, that consists of four one Bit<BR>
logic units (which emit the propagate signals P and the generate<BR>
signals G), some circuitry labeled "command mapping" to convert<BR>
the three control signals S2..S0 into the 8 control signals which<BR>
configurate/drive the logic units... plus the CEN signal,<BR>
which enables the carry chain in arithmetic mode.

<P>Oh, and I nearly forgot to mention the XOR gates which are fed<BR>
by the propagate signals and the carry chain.

<P>74381 emits /P and /G signals, what makes this IC interesting<BR>
for building fast/big ALUs by linking said ICs together with a 74182...<BR>
which is described later in this article.

<P>74382 lacks the /P and /G outputs, but features a carry and overflow<BR>
output instead, what will do for building 8 Bit ALUs.

<HR>

<P>Now to take a look into the boxes which are labeled "logic unit".

<P><IMG SRC="a7_382_lu.png">

<P>/PS3..0, /GS3..0 have to be low_active, because the multiplexers<BR>
have inverted outputs.<P>

<HR>

<P>A list, of what operation the ALU should do according to the<BR>
S2..S0 control signals... and what the control signals inside<BR>
the ALU should look like to make this possible:

<P><IMG SRC="a7_382_ct.png">

<P>And here the circuitry that turns S2..0 into said signals:

<P>Note, that /GS1 always is 1.
