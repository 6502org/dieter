<P>The somewhat exotic 74AS882 from TI was designed for linking<BR>
8 ALUs together... but it only had 4 carry outputs.

<P>Makes sense, because it reduces the circuitry inside<BR>
the carry chain, and the wiring between the ICs looks<BR>
a little bit nicer.

<P>I wish, I would have used a similar concept in my MT15 CPU.

<P>A similar IC was the 100179 (National Semiconductor),<BR>
except that it had a different pinout, low active /P, /G<BR>
and /Cn, /Cn+something signals... and that it was ECL.
