<HR>

<P>I'm not exactly sure about the practical value of implementing<BR>
this design, but because it looks very different from everything<BR>
else I have seen so far, I felt a need to mention it.

<P>Note, that this article only gives you a simplified concept about<BR>
what things really may look like.<BR>
And that I'm using a different notation from the original description.

<P>The original description (available at Bitsavers) is written<BR>
like one of them boring scientific publications, be warned.

<HR>

<P>One adder cell:

<P><IMG SRC="a7_g20_l1.png">

<P><B>G</B> (generate) generates a carry if A=1 and B=1.

<P><B>PC</B> (propagate carry) propagates a carry from the previous Bit<BR>
if A=1 or B=1.

<P><B>K</B> (kill) indicates, that A=0 and B=0, and that no carry<BR>
comes out of the adder cell regardless of the carry input.

<P><B>PK</B> (propagate kill) says that no carry propgates through<BR>
from the previous Bit.

<HR>

<P>Now to pack the adder cell schematic into a cute little box:

<P><IMG SRC="a7_g20_s1.png">

<P>And to connect four Boxes for building a 4 Bit adder.

<HR>

<P>Logic signals at the Q0 adder:

<P><IMG SRC="a7_g20_t1.png">

<HR>

<P>An idea for a fast lookahead carry.<BR>
The original text calls this a "leap frog" carry chain.<BR>
Note the signals LFK (leap frog kill) and LFC (leap frog carry).

<P><IMG SRC="a7_g20_f1.png">

<P>And yes, I did draw this a bit different from the original text.<BR>
The two_input OR gates only are drawn to simplify things,<BR>
you could replace the four_input NOR gates inside the Q3 adder<BR>
by five_input NOR gates for getting rid of said OR gates.

<P>Would be interesting to find out what takes less logic gates:<BR>
Building a 74182 based fast lookahead carry adder...<BR>
or building a fast adder "the Bendix way".
