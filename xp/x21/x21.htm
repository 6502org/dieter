<P>An experimental attempt of building something like a 6521\6821<BR>
with 74XX TTL chips.

<P>The design might have some issues,<BR>
try reading the schematics at your own risk...

<P>I\O and bus connectors are supposed to be compatible<BR>
to Daryl Rictor's SBC-2.

<P><HR>

<P><B>Test setup:</B>
<P>Bottom: my DRC2 SBC, which is supposed to be compatible to the SBC-2.<BR>
<P>2B22 bus interface from the X22 project (6522) is plugged into DRC2.<BR>
X21 backplane is plugged into the 2B22 bus interface.<BR>

<P>Plugged into the X21 backplane, we have:<BR>
1* 1PA22, Port A module                    <BR>
1* 1PB22, Port B module                    <BR>
2* H21, handshake module

<P><B>X21 backplane:</B>
<P><IMG SRC="x21.jpg">

<P>Jumper\switch in the upper left area is for enabling the blinkenlights.<BR>

<P>Jumpers in the lower left area are for connecting the Port A, Port B<BR>
related interrupt outputs to either NMI or IRQ.

<P>Jumpers in the lower middle area are for generating handshake signals<BR>
which the original 6521\6821 is not supposed to have,<BR>
the default setting for those two jumpers is OPEN.

<P><HR>

<P><B>2B22 bus interface</B>
<P><IMG SRC="2b22.jpg">

<P>The jumper field in the lower right area is for the chip select.

<P>The bus interface is from the X22 project (6522),<BR>
what means that it decodes A0..A3.<BR>
Unlike the 6522, the 6521\6821 doesn't have 16 registers,<BR>
so for better compatibility it's possible to deactivate<BR>
the unused address lines with the three jumpers<BR>
in the lower left area of the PCB.

<P><HR>

<P><B>1PA22 Port A module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="1pa22.jpg">

<P>Port A has open collector outputs.

<P>There is a pullup resistor network for the port lines<BR>
in the schematic and layout of the port lines.<BR>

<P>I suggest to solder a single row precision socket into the PCB,<BR>
to make sure that you are able to try different resistor values,<BR>
or to go without pullup resistors if necessary.

<P><HR>

<P><B>1PB22 Port B module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="1pb22.jpg">

<P>Port B has three state outputs.

<P>There is a pullup resistor network for the port lines<BR>
in the schematic and layout of the port lines.<BR>

<P>I suggest to solder a single row precision socket into the PCB,<BR>
to make sure that you are able to try different resistor values,<BR>
or to go without pullup resistors if necessary.

<P>BTW: Port A module and Port B module have identical pinouts.

<P><HR>

<P><B>H21 handshake module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="h21.jpg">

<P>Two identical handshake modules required.

<P>One handles CA1 and CA2, the other handles CB1 and CB2.
