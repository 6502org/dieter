<CENTER><H1>X45 &lt; 6545\6845</H1></CENTER>

<P>An experimental attempt of building something like a 6545\6845<BR>
with 74XX TTL chips.

<P><B>The design certainly has some issues,</B><BR>
But it isn't impossible to generate a video signal with it...

<P>Try reading the schematics at your own risk.

<P><B>ATN:</B><BR>
X45 generates a 16 Bit video address,<BR>
and from the timing specifications,<BR>
it outputs said address faster than a 6545\6845.

<P>Because of this, the X45 video address is emitted<BR>
by 74573 latches, what gives you a chance to tweak<BR>
the timing a little bit if necessary.

<P>Needless to say,<BR>
that the load signal for those latches should be high,<BR>
and that the output enable for those latches should be low<BR>
for getting a valid video address...

<P><HR>

<P><B>Test setup:</B>
<P>Bottom: my DRC2 SBC, which is supposed to be compatible to the SBC-2.<BR>
D45 demonstrator is plugged into DRC2.<BR>
X45 backplane is plugged into D45.

<P>Plugged into the X45 backplane, we have:  <BR>
1* B45, bus interface                        <BR>
1* C45, the control module                   <BR>
1* T45, horizontal\vertical timing module    <BR>
1* R45, raster timing module                 <BR>
2* G45, two video address generator modules  

<P><IMG SRC="x_45.jpg">

<P>Note the thin red wire at the left:<BR>
it is necessary to run the CPU with a 2 MHz clock,<BR>
which is generated from the D45 demonstrator.

<P><HR>
<P><IMG SRC="x_45_pic.jpg">

<P>80*25 text,<BR>
2 MHz clock,<BR>
15.625 kHz horizontal,<BR>
50 Hz vertical,<BR>
8 raster lines per character,<BR>
non_interlaced.

<P>Ignore that odd text format:<BR>
Software does 40*25 text, hardware does 80*25 text.

<P>Register settings:<BR>
R0 =0x7F <BR>
R1 =0x50 <BR>
R2 =0x5E <BR>
R3 =0xAA // it's just a guess...<BR>
R4 =0x26 <BR>
R5 =0x00 <BR>
R6 =0x19 <BR>
R7 =0x1F <BR>
R8 =0x00 <BR>
R9 =0x07 <BR>
R12=0x04 <BR>
R13=0x00 <BR>

<P>Todo: check, if this is compatible to a real 6545\6845...<BR>
The register settings are just a guess, of course,<BR>
because I was happy to eventually get a video signal at all...

<P>80*50 text,<BR>
2 MHz clock,<BR>

<P><B>Issues:</B>

<P>Looks like there is a conceptual mistake in the circuitry<BR>
of the raster address counter\comparator...<BR>
but fixing this most certainly will cause _other_ issues...

<P>Also, there is a problem with R5, vertical total adjust.<BR>
0x00 will work correctly: no additional raster lines inserted.<BR>
For all other values, one raster line is inserted too many...

<P>BTW: Light pen interface isn't fully tested.

<P><HR>

<P>X45 supports straight binary addressing mode (normal 16 Bit counter)<BR>
and row\column addressing mode (8 Bit counter row, 8 Bit counter column),<BR>
depending on register 8 Bit 2.

<P><HR>

<P><B>D45 demonstrator</B>
<P><IMG SRC="d45.jpg">

<P>Contains a video RAM, a character generator ROM,<BR>
a shift register, an analog video output...<BR>
and a clock generator.<BR>

<P>Said clock generator has to drive the CPU with 2 MHz.

<P>One line of text is supposed to have 80 characters.

<P>Because I ran out of 100 nF capacitors in "standard package",<BR>
I soldered 100 nF SMD capacitors at the bottom of the PCB.

<P>A DIP switch was supposed to be plugged into that 8 pin IC socket.<BR>
Unfortunately, when plugging that switch into the socket,<BR>
there will be mechanical problems when plugging D45 and X45 together...<BR>
so I just soldered 4 pins of that socket to GND, and then to be done with.

<P><HR>

<P><B>X45 backplane:</B>
<P><IMG SRC="x45.jpg">

<P>Ignore that green piece of wire...

<P>Jumper\switch in the lower left area is for enabling the blinkenlights.<BR>

<P>The jumpers in the upper left area are for the output enable<BR>
for the 74573 latches which emit raster and video address.<BR>
When using X45 together with D45, leave them OPEN.

<P>The jumpers in the upper right area handle the chip select signals.

<P>Note that piece of Tesa (TM) in the upper middle area,<BR>
for preventing short circuits between traces at the bottom of the X45 PCB<BR>
and the metal can oscillator at the top of the D45 PCB...

<P><HR>

<P><B>C45 control module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="c45.jpg">

<P>That's the place where the control signals for all those counters<BR>
and the status output signals from all those comparators are going to meet.

<P>Schematics still are a bit messy,<BR>
contain a few little errors,<BR>
and are not optimized for speed.

<P>Don't mind those wires, I think I already fixed this<BR>
in the schematics and in the PCB layout.
<P><HR>

<P><B>T45 horizontal\vertical timing module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="t45.jpg">

<P>Horizontal\vertical related registers, counters, comparators etc.

<P><HR>

<P><B>R45 raster timing module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="r45.jpg">

<P>Raster timing and cursor.

<P><HR>

<P><B>G45 8 Bit video address generator module</B><BR>
Two PCBs required,<BR>
two PCBs shown in the picture:
<P><IMG SRC="g45.jpg">

<P>Doing a layout for one 16 Bit module turned out<BR>
to be a little bit too difficult,<BR>
so I had to split that part into two modules 8 Bit each.
