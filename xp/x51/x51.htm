<CENTER><H1>Failed: X51 &lt; 6551</H1></CENTER>

<P>A failed experimental attempt of building something like a 6551<BR>
with 74XX TTL chips.

<P>Most things are untested, the schematics are a mess,<BR>
and there is no documentation.

<P>Failed to get the 2R51 receiver working at all.<BR>
I'm not sure, if my concept for the receiver was the right approach.<BR>
Decided, that it's better not to include that receiver<BR>
into the project files, to prevent people from following me<BR>
an a track which probably might be wrong.

<P>If you made it to build a working receiver,<BR>
please post the schematics.

<P><HR>

<P><B>Test setup:</B>
<P>Bottom: my DRC2 SBC, which is supposed to be compatible to the SBC-2.<BR>
<P>2B22 bus interface is plugged into DRC2.<BR>
1X51 backplane is plugged into the 2B22 bus interface.<BR>

<P>Plugged into the 1X51 backplane, we have:  <BR>
1* 1C51, control module                       <BR>
1* 2F51, flag and status module               <BR>
1* 2R51, receiver module                      <BR>
1* 2T51, transmitter module                   <BR>
1* G51, baud rate generator module            <BR>
1* D51, RS232 level converter module

<P><B>1X51 backplane:</B>
<P><IMG SRC="1x51.jpg">

<P>This module is used in the X50 and X51 project.

<P>Because register addresses for both projects are different,<BR>
we have to compensate this with a few jumpers in the left upper area<BR>
of the PCB.

<P>Also, there is a three pin jumper for connecting the interupt output<BR>
either with NMI or IRQ.

<P>The jumper in the right lower area enables the blinkenlights.

<P><B>D51 RS232 level converter module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="d51.jpg">

<P>RS232 to TTL and back level converter.<BR>
Concept and jumper field are stolen from Daryl's SBC-2.

<P>This module is used in the X50 and X51 project.

<P><HR>

<P><B>G51 baud rate generator module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="g51.jpg">

<P>All those odd 6551 baud rates...

<P>The 100 nF capacitors are hidden below the IC sockets.

<P><HR>

<P><B>1C51 control module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="1c51.jpg">

<P>This module contains registers and some circuitry<BR>
for making the CPU able to set some control signals...<BR>
including baud rate selection.

<P><HR>

<P><B>2F51 flag and status module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="2f51.jpg">

<P>Flags and status.

<P><HR>

<P><B>2R51 receiver module</B><BR>
<P><IMG SRC="2r51.jpg">

<P>That's the part which horribly failed,<BR>
and which isn't in the project files.

<P>Unfortunately, this module is used in the X50 and X51 project.

<P><HR>

<P><B>2T51 transmitter module</B><BR>
<P><IMG SRC="2t51.jpg">

<P>Parallel to serial converter...

<P>This module is used in the X50 and X51 project.
