<P><BIG><B>WARNING:<BR>
The designs here have issues\bugs, <BR>
and are only on this page for the C74 project<BR>
as a reference what things to do different.

<P>Trying to rebuild any of that stuff in here<BR>
most certainly will bring you into trouble,<BR>
again: thou shalt not rebuild it.</B></BIG>

<P><IMG SRC="x_bug.jpg">

<P>The plan was to build production quality peripherals and maybe to build transistorized peripherals later...<BR>
what went cut back to only building production quality peripherals...<BR>
what went cut back to just building experimental peripherals with some neat documentation...<BR>
(this was supposed to take one year),<BR>
what went cut back to just getting that stuff off my desk after three years and a half,<BR>
no matter what...

<P>...as my workflow was disrupted just a few times too many.

<P>As a result, the designs have issues, the documentation has plenty of potholes,<BR>
and <B>the schematics should not be trusted</B> too much.

<P>The things in here are only a starting point <B>for those who dare</B><BR>
building 65xx peripherals from 74xx TTL chips.<BR>
Nothing more, nothing less.

<P><B>Be aware</B>, that it might take some years of hard work<BR>
to turn those schematics and PCB layouts into something useful,<BR>
that you are on your own when making a try,<BR>
and that you enter in here at your own risk.

<P><HR>

<P>Maybe I better should have used an uni_directional bus structure in those peripherals,<BR>
because this would have improved speed and simplified timing.

<P><HR>

<P>Peripherals:
<P><A HREF="x21/x21.htm">X21 &lt; 6521</A>, maybe some minor issues.
<P><A HREF="x22/x22.htm">X22 &lt; 6522</A>, maybe some minor issues.
<P><A HREF="x23/x23.htm">X23 &lt; 6523</A>, but no 6523 bus interface.
<P><A HREF="x32/x32.htm">X32 &lt; 6532</A>, maybe some minor issues.
<P><A HREF="x45/x45.htm">X45 &lt; 6545</A>, <B>most certainly some issues.</B>
<P><A HREF="x50/x50.htm">X50 &lt; 6850</A>, <B>failed.</B>
<P><A HREF="x51/x51.htm">X51 &lt; 6551</A>, <B>failed.</B>

<P><HR>

<P>Some PCBs that failed, quite a few of them due to "workflow disruption":
<P><IMG SRC="x_scrap.jpg">

<P><HR>

<P>Now for something funny:

<P><IMG SRC="junior.jpg">

<P><B>Right: 1980, my first hobby computing project.</B><BR>
The Elektor Junior Computer.

<P><B>Left: 2015, this is supposed to be my last hobby computing project.</B><BR>
X32, experimental 6532 built with 74xx TTL chips.<BR>
(only 32 Bytes of 74HCT574 "RAM" installed.)

<P>The 6532 chip is pulled out of the socked in the Junior Computer,<BR>
and X32 controlls the display and the keyboard.<BR>
Woot !

<P><HR>
<P>When I was a 13 years old kid, toying with the 6502,<BR>
I was aware that them chips are just made from logic gates and flipflops.<BR>
And that "the magic" is just how those elements are connected together<BR>
to form a computer.

<P>35 years later, I still have no clue about how those gates and flipflops<BR>
are connected together in the original chips...<BR>
But in theory, we now could imagine how to connect logic gates and flipflops<BR>
together for "rolling our own stuff".

<P>And after spending too many years in a workshop toying with ill fated projects,<BR>
maybe it's about time to try some non_technical hobbies.

<P>Now...<BR>
Get off my lawn !
