<P>This isn't exactly a 6523,<BR>
because it has no 6523 bus interface.

<P>I just used it as a "test adaptor"<BR>
for the 2B22 bus interface and the I\O port modules<BR>
from the X22 (6522) project.

<P>I\O and bus connectors are supposed to be compatible<BR>
to Daryl Rictor's SBC-2.

<P>Jumper\switch in the upper left area is for enabling the blinkenlights.<BR>

<P><B>2B22 bus interface</B>
<P><IMG SRC="2b22.jpg">

<P>The jumper field in the lower right area is for the chip select.

<P>The bus interface is from the X22 project (6522),<BR>
what means that it decodes A0..A3.<BR>
Unlike the 6522, the 6523 doesn't have 16 registers,<BR>
so for better compatibility it's possible to deactivate<BR>
the unused address lines with the three jumpers<BR>
in the lower left area of the PCB.

<P><B>1PA22 Port A module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="1pa22.jpg">

<P>Port A has open collector outputs.

<P>There is a pullup resistor network for the port lines<BR>
in the schematic and layout of the port lines.<BR>

<P>I suggest to solder a single row precision socket into the PCB,<BR>
to make sure that you are able to try different resistor values,<BR>
or to go without pullup resistors if necessary.

<P><B>1PB22 Port B module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="1pb22.jpg">

<P>Port B has three state outputs.

<P>There is a pullup resistor network for the port lines<BR>
in the schematic and layout of the port lines.<BR>

<P>I suggest to solder a single row precision socket into the PCB,<BR>
to make sure that you are able to try different resistor values,<BR>
or to go without pullup resistors if necessary.

<P>BTW: Port A module and Port B module have identical pinouts.
