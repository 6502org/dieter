<P>An experimental attempt of building something like a 6532<BR>
with 74XX TTL chips.

<P>The design might have some issues,<BR>
try reading the schematics at your own risk...<BR>
you better check, if the circuitry which detects timer overflow<BR>
works as intended...<BR>
and the prescaler isn't set to :1 by the timer interrupt.

<P>I\O and bus connectors are supposed to be compatible<BR>
to Daryl Rictor's SBC-2...<BR>
but X32 also has a bus connector that is supposed to fit<BR>
to the Elektor Junior Computer.

<P><HR>

<P><B>Test setup:</B>
<P>Bottom: my DRC2 SBC, which is supposed to be compatible to the SBC-2.<BR>
X32 backplane is plugged into DRC2.<BR>

<P>Plugged into the X32 backplane, we are supposed to have:     <BR>
1* 1PA22, Port A module                                         <BR>
1* 1PB22, Port B module                                         <BR>
1* T32, timer module                                            <BR>
1* I32, timer control and interrupt module                      <BR>
4* R32, 4* 32 Bytes of RAM that is... (only 1 module was built) <BR>
1* B32, bus interface <BR>

<P><B>X32 backplane:</B>
<P><IMG SRC="x32.jpg">

<P>Jumper\switch in the lower left area is for enabling the blinkenlights.<BR>

<P>The jumpers in the right upper area are for handling chip select signals,<BR>
and for connecting the interrupt output either to NMI or IRQ.

<P>The jumpers in the right lower area are for selecting<BR>
if X32 works with a DRC2, or with the Elektor Junior Computer.<BR>

<P>Please consult the X32 schematics,<BR>
to see which jumper does what,<BR>
and how the X32 shows up in the DRC2 memory map.

<P><B>Warning:<BR>
That 31 pin female connector at the left was supposed<BR>
to resemble the Junior Computer I\O port pinout,<BR>
but something went wrong:<BR>
pinout is reversed.</B>

<P>I suggest to correct the package of the connector,
the schematics, the PCB layout...<BR>
or to solder the connector into the bottom of the PCB instead.

<P>When making a redesign, maybe you should include a SRAM socket<BR>
into the backplane because not everybody might like soldering<BR>
a 128 Bytes SRAM from 74574 chips...

<P>About that connector at the right for plugging X32<BR>
into the Junior computer:<BR>
Note, that like with the Junior Computer,<BR>
the connector is at the bottom of the PCB !

<P>I only had a female 96 pin 90 deg connector in the drawer,<BR>
not a 64 pin connector as required...<BR>
that's why the layout shows a 96 in connector.<BR>
The row of pins in the middle of the connector is unused.

<P><B>One more thing: be very careful</B> when plugging X32<BR>
into a Junior Computer, because at the connector of said computer<BR>
we have -5V and +12 V present.<BR>
One little mistake there could be going to be quite expensive.

<P><HR>

<P><B>1PA22 Port A module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="1pa22.jpg">

<P>Port A has open collector outputs.

<P>There is a pullup resistor network for the port lines<BR>
in the schematic and layout of the port lines.<BR>

<P>I suggest to solder a single row precision socket into the PCB,<BR>
to make sure that you are able to try different resistor values,<BR>
or to go without pullup resistors if necessary.

<P><HR>

<P><B>1PB22 Port B module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="1pb22.jpg">

<P>Port B has three state outputs.

<P>There is a pullup resistor network for the port lines<BR>
in the schematic and layout of the port lines.<BR>

<P>I suggest to solder a single row precision socket into the PCB,<BR>
to make sure that you are able to try different resistor values,<BR>
or to go without pullup resistors if necessary.

<P>BTW: Port A module and Port B module have identical pinouts.

<P><HR>

<P><B>T32 8 Bit timer module with prescaler</B>
<P><IMG SRC="t32.jpg">

<P>BTW: failed to buy synchronous down counters.

<P>So I just took 74163 synchronous up counters<BR>
and inverted their inputs and outputs with 7404,<BR>
to make them up_counters look like down_counters<BR>
for the CPU...

<P><HR>

<P><B>I32 timer control and interrupt module</B>
<P><IMG SRC="i32.jpg">

<P>This module controls the timer, does edge detection,<BR>
and generates the interrupt.

<P><HR>

<P><B>R32, 32 Bytes of SRAM...</B><BR>
This PCB has ICs at both sides,<BR>
similar to the register section of my old TREX CPU project.

<P>Top:

<P>Bottom:
<P><IMG SRC="r32_bot.jpg">

<P>Soldering something like that sure isn't for beginners...

<P>Don't worry about that pullup resistor,<BR>
I have already integrated it into the schematic and layout...<BR>
I think.

<P>BTW: when buying a few hundred 74HCT574 at a big distributor,<BR>
price for them chips goes down pretty much.

<P>Sure, it would have been possible to use a single SRAM chip instead.<BR>
But hey... that's your chance to build your own Atari 2600 from TTL chips.<BR>
