Traffic lights, an unpleasent thematic.
<P>
Controlling traffic lights usually takes part at beginner classes,<BR>
to teach the basics of programming or digital design.<BR>
It is known to have bored generations of pupils/students<BR>
out of their minds.
<P>
Unfortunately, I don't have a better example.


<HR>

<P>
To start simple:<BR>
One road, a narrow spot (maybe roadworks), two traffic lights<BR>
(each one with three different colours).


<P><IMG SRC="mpdroad1.png">

<P>
Obviously, two cars driving in different directions won't fit<BR>
through at the same time.<BR>
Only one traffic light can be green, while the other is red.

<P>
Now to define, what one traffic light should do.


<P><IMG SRC="mpd_phas.png">

<P><PRE>
<B>green:          </B>drive through.
<B>yellow:         </B>prepare to stop, or hurry up. deceide !
<B>red:            </B>stop.
<B>red and yellow: </B>prepare to start racing.
</PRE>
<P>
We could imagine one complete 360 degree cylinder rotation to happen<BR>
within 6 minutes (360 seconds), <BR>what would make one degree per second.<BR>
To be independend of rotating speed, the axis is labeled with graduations.

<P><I>
(Phases are not to scale with a "real" traffic light, but drawings look<BR>
nicer that way.)
</I>
<P>
After 360 degrees of rotation, the cylinder will start again at 0 degrees.<BR>
We can imagine to take the blue axis, and to bend it to form a circle.<BR>
Then we draw our colours into that circle...


<P><IMG SRC="mpd_circ.png">

<P>
We imagine a disc, rotating counterclockwise.<BR>
For the three lightbulbs of one traffic light, we place the switches<BR>
at 0 degrees.<BR>
Switches for the tree light bulbs of the other traffic light are placed<BR>
180 degrees away.<BR>
Note the red arrows, marking the positions of the switches.

<P>
And now, we know what to do.


<P><IMG SRC="mpd_disc.png">

<P>
We just build tree metal discs (one per colour), and cut away anything<BR>
that is not marked blue (ignore the lines used for construction).<BR>
Since we have a big hole in the center of every disc, we turn them<BR>
90 degrees to the left, and stick trough our cylinder.

<P>
Now to add switches, wires, light bulbs, motor and gear.

<P><IMG SRC="mpd_rot.png">

<P>
Coming to mind, that the sequencer of the washing machine <B>had</B> two rows<BR>
of switches, 180 degrees apart.<BR>
All we have to do, is to replace the gear (for a faster rotation speed),<BR>
and the cylinder (for another "program").


<P>But what, if we have two roads ?

<P><IMG SRC="mpdroad2.png">

<P>
For a crossing, we first connect two traffic lights (blue marked casting)<BR>
with our sequencer.<BR>
The left and the right traffic light show always the same color.<BR>
Same thing for the upper and lower traffic light.<BR>
Looks like we can use our sequencer without modifications,<BR> 
when connecting two light bulbs in parallel.
