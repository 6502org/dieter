Cylinder music box, made between 1810 and 1900.<BR>
The cylinder is rotated by clockwork/spring motor.<BR>
Tiny steel pins on the surface trigger parts of a steel "comb",
that makes the sound.<BR>

Sequencer of a washing machine, circa 1970, pre-microcontroller era.<BR>
The cylinder is rotated by an electric motor.<BR>
The shape of the surface is used to open/close switches,<BR>
to control pumps/motors, solenoid valves, and an electric heater.<BR>
<I>There are rumors, that such things could be still in production.</I>

Noticed something ?


<P>
It's all about triggering a given "thing" at a predetermined time from start.<BR>
Both machines use a slowly rotating cylinder, with a "program" of what<BR>
to do at which moment encoded at the surface.

<P>
Could we stick both cylinders onto one rotating axis ?<BR>
The idea of building a music playing washing machine (or a laundry<BR>
washing music box) looks weird/peculiar at first thought...<BR>
but not as much as building your own processor at home from scrap.

<P>
When taking a close look at the washing machine sequencer, we can<BR>
imagine that there was a button at one end of the axis, to manually<BR>
select parts of the "program".<BR>
To prevent the laundry from being washed and washed again, there was<BR>
a switch to turn of the motor, when the cylinder reached (for instance)<BR>
350 degrees of rotation.<BR>
To start again, the sequencer had to be manually reset (for instance)<BR>
10 degrees ahead to zero.
