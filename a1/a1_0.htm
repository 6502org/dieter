<P>The 74XX family contains a few ALU chips,<BR>
the 74181, 74381, and 74382.

<P>
The question is: what should we do, if they are no longer available.<BR>
To many of us hobbyists, an ALU still is some kind of black box,<BR>
with lots of wires going in and out.

<P>
Tried to make up my own thoughts on this, but was unable<BR>
to get/obtain much really useful literature. <BR>
Never studied engineering or computer architecture<BR>
at a university.

<P>
Decided to write together, what came out<BR>
when toying around with this subject.
