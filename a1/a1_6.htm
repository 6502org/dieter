<HR>

<P>And here we go.<BR>
We take an Adder, and add the results from two of our Logic Units.

<P><IMG SRC="a1_adalu.png">

<P>
Logic: Y is set to 0x00, what is added to the result X<BR>
from the upper logic unit, and then put out on Q.<BR>
<I>For logic operations, we have to force the Adder carry input to 0,<BR>
to prevent it from unintentionally incrementing Q.</I>

<P>Incrementing is simple.<BR>
Keep Y at 0x00, pass A (or B) into X,<BR>
<I>and force the Adder carry input to 1.</I>

<P>
For shifting something left, both Logic Units are configurated<BR>
to the same logic function.<BR>
When X=Y, the Adder multiplies the Logic Unit result by two,<BR>
<I>what is identical to shifting it left.</I>

<P>For shifting something right, X is connected to the output multiplexer<BR>
in a way to shift all Bits one place to the right,<BR>
as explained in the previous ALU example.

<P>For Arithmetic, both Logic Units can be set so that<BR>
X = 0x00, 0xff, A, NOT A<BR>
Y = 0x00, 0xff, B, NOT B<BR>
What allows us to add, subtract or decrement,<BR>
as we already know.

<P>
Not shown in this block diagram is a 4:1 carry input multiplexer<BR>
(switches between 0, 1, Carry_Flag),<BR>
and a 2:1 carry output multiplexer<BR>
(switching between X0 during SHR and Adder carry output<BR>
for everything else).

<P>
Half as many components as the previous ALU,<BR>
a better/cleaner structure,
faster, and more functionality.

<P>The ideal choice for bread board experiments.<BR>
When using 74ACT, this design should be nearly as fast<BR>
as the venerable 74F181/74S181, but cheaper,<BR>
with a lower power consumption,<BR>
and an increased functionality.

<P>The only "Black Box" left that we don't know<BR>
from the inside at gate level is the adder.

<P>Now to dissect it.
