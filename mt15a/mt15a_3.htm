<P>Now to describe the logic gates, used in MT15.

<P>Did first experiments with BC547/BC557 transistors at a 5V supply.

<P>The story, how it came to BC847/BC857 SMD transistors powered<BR>
with 2.5V would fill a complete article.

<P>Point is, that PCB size is a <B>primary cost factor</B>.

<P>Did not notice any difference between standard BC547/BC557 and<BR>
SMD BC847/BC857 in electrical parameters during experimentation.

<P>Most of the logic gates used in MT15 are open_collector TTL NANDs.<BR>
(TTL = transistor transistor logic).

<P><IMG SRC="mt15a_nand.png">

<P>Note the speed_up capacitor in parallel to the two 1N4148.<BR>
220pF should work, but since it was difficult to buy them in a<BR>
sort of 0204 SMD package, I did solder 1nF capacitors instead.

<P>NAND means "negated AND". So if A=HIGH and B=HIGH, Q=LOW.<BR>
Treshold voltage at the inputs is about 1.3V, so connecting them<BR>
to outputs from 74xx integrated logic ICs shouldn't be a problem.

<P>When connecting the output of the transistorised logic gate<BR>
to 74xx logic, please use 74HCT/74ACT.<BR>
<I>74LS/74F would require a modification of the pullup_resistor<BR>
at the output.</I>

<P>Under optimal test conditions (2.5V supply, A,B are driven with<BR>
74xx, low capacitance at Q, etc.), propagation delay from A,B to Q<BR>
is around <B>35ns.</B><BR>
Under "real_world" conditions, with long PCB traces, expect<BR>
something between 50..60ns.

<P>Supply voltage should be 2.4V to 2.6V.<BR>
Don't forget to place one 100nF capacitor into the power supply<BR>
of each logic gate.

<P>Now for another neat trick:

<P><IMG SRC="mt15a_nand1.png">

<P>Since the gates have open_collector outputs, it is possible<BR>
to wire the outputs from multiple gates together to one single<BR>
330 Ohm pullup resistor.

<P>The result would be a AND/NOR combination.<BR>
MT15 makes use of this feature.

<P>For more examples what to do with AND/NOR,<BR>
please consult/dissect old 74LS/74S datasheets.

<HR>

<P>Now for something pretty evil:<BR>
<B>CTL</B>, complementary transistor logic.

<P><IMG SRC="mt15a_and.png">

<P>Basically, we take the PNP intputs from our NAND gate,<BR>
and attach a NPN transistor.

<P>The rest is known from ECL emitter dotting.

<P>Trick is, to select the pullup/pulldown_resistors in a way,<BR>
that a 1.3V input signal level may result in a (nearly) 1.3V<BR>
output signal, <BR>for keeping/maintaining treshold level of the<BR>
TTL logic gates connected to the output.

<P>Now for some neat open_emitter wiring:

<P><IMG SRC="mt15a_and1.png">

<P>MT15 uses such things inside the carry logic,<BR>
and in the instruction decoder/sequencer.

<P>CTL is fast, but has three disadvantages:<BR>
There is a chance to waste/burn more energy than with ECL,<BR>
it collects (and passes through) any "dirt" at the input signals.

<P><IMG SRC="mt15a_level.png">

<P>And, since there are no inverters, it doesn't amplify.<BR>
<I>Please don't take the picture above too optimistic,<BR>
it's for 3.3V  CTL..</I><BR>
<I>2.5V CTL has a maximum output level of ca. 1.85V.</I>

<P>Connecting more than three such AND/OR combinations<BR>
in series could be considered to be a <B>bad strategy</B><BR>
for building a reliable design.
