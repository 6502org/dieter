<P>The most important lesson I have learned during this project was never to use<BR>
74HCT ICs for driving backplanes, especially when a big electronics company<BR>
from the Netherlands somehow was involved in the production process of said ICs.

<P>For driving backplanes, better resort to old (non_RoHS conform) 74LS/74ALS<BR>
parts, manufactured by Fairchild or TI.<BR>
...Shrinking chip geometries isn't always a good thing.

<P>If you happen to buy 74LS parts in DIP package (especially those with a<BR>
readable engraving on top of the case), buy plenty of them like if it would<BR>
be your last chance, maybe because it really could be your last chance.

<P>Same thing for RAMs in DIP package, especially fast RAMs.

<P>When buying IC sockets and connectors, don't save money on the wrong end,<BR>
<I>it isn't worth the trouble.</I>

<P>Don't buy cheap power supplies.<BR>
If you happen to have an adjustable power supply and want to use it for your<BR>
TTL hobby projects, better check if it delivers a spike of more than 5V at<BR>
the output when switching it on/off.

<HR>

<P>Chances are low to build something like a 68k compatible TTL CPU at home,<BR>
but it might be possible to build something running at more or less<BR>
the same speed as a 16 MHz 68000.

<P><I>...and a 16 MHz 68000 is capable of running uClinux.</I>

<P>There is a chance of building an open hardware platform, able to run some<BR>
serious software...<BR>
but there always are two important questions questions:<BR>
1) Is it future proof ?<BR>
2) Is it worth the trouble ?

<P>TTL hobby computing takes a lot of time and effort to build.

<P>I somehow doubt that more than a handful of people will show serious<BR>
interest in TTL hobby computing, except for the academic value.<BR>
<I>(Teaching students how a computer works in detail).</I>

<P>There is a difference between looking at some computer related exhibits<BR>
in the showcases of a university, and trying to build your own TTL CPU.

<P>And it's nearly as big as the difference between watching the remains<BR>
of dead wales in a museum, and suddenly finding yourself <I>standing on<BR>
deck of a tiny ship on the big ocean in midst of heavy sea and really<BR>
bad weather while someone is shouting "MAN THE HARPOON !"<BR>
into your ears.</I>

<P>In both cases, there is a chance of reaching a point where you refuse<BR>
to eat something like fish for the rest of your life.

<HR>

<P>Building a 32 Bit TTL CPU was fun, but it's more a full time job for<BR>
(at least) two engineers rather than a spare time project for a lone,<BR>
little hobbyist.

<P>As in Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times", the modern world of working contracts<BR>
(or working conditions) doesn't seem to leave much spare time for hobby projects<BR>
anymore.<BR>
<I>If you have thoughts about to do your electronics hobby for a living<BR>
(maybe after reading some articles), please think again.</I>

<P>That's all for now.
