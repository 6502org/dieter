<P><I>"What is the best architecture for a CPU ?"</I>

<P>A question, which is often asked by beginners.

<P>It depends on different factors.

<P>It's a compromise between how much time, effort and money you are<BR>
willing to spend to gain enough functionality and speed for your project.

<P>Too much functionality may reduce speed, but too less functionality<BR>
may limit the fun when trying writing software for your CPU later.

<P>Also, please don't try to forget that you might feel the need to repair<BR>
or modify your design somedays.

<P>Another question is availability of the parts...<BR>
and if you will be able to still build your design some years in the future.

<HR>

<P><I>"Why don't you use modern technology like FPGAs and such ?"</I>

<P>I'm already using FPGAs at work since a while.<BR>
(This article was written in 2008).

<P>But if you would be working in a fast food place for years,<BR>
you would eat (nearly) anything but burgers at home.

<P>Sure, ICs are getting faster and cheaper with every year, but quality<BR>
and the potential for <B>practical use</B> seems to be spiraling downwards.

<P>If you want to pull a brewery waggon, you won't go far with racing horses.

<P>As a hobbyist, I would be more happy with reliable and robust technology.<BR>
Reinventing the wheel every now and then for non_technical reasons ain't fun...

<HR>

<P>But I'm getting off topic.

<P>Now back to "the making" of the 32 Bit TTL RISC CPU.

<P>I really felt tempted to try a transistorised implementation for our cute little<BR>
"dinosaur". But the experiments with DECL based flipflops didn't go well, and<BR>
it became obvious that I would have to invest some more time, money and effort<BR>
into basic research...

<P>While strolling through a city in Germany, I did decide to visit a small<BR>
electronics hobby shop. Did have an interesting talk with the owner<BR>
of said shop.

<P>"GALs and EEPROMs ? We don't have them on stock, because nobody buys this<BR>
stuff. No, we don't have 74573/74574, and we won't order them. In fact, if one<BR>
of the 74LS drawers in this shelf goes empty, <B>we don't refill it anymore.</B>"

<P>There is a joke that half of the city is employed at the university, while<BR>
the rest is employed at the R&D facilities of a very big electronics company.<BR>
<I>...go figure.</I>

<P>Anyhow, I did decide to investigate what TTL ICs the store still had on stock.<BR>
It looked like some of the ICs were older than 10, 20 years.<BR>
<I>(It's been a while, that Motorola did manufacture 74LS parts.)</I><BR>
<B>And I then dug out a treasure:<BR>
a handful of ancient 54LS181 from Texas Instruments</B>.<BR>
The 54LS181 basically is a 74LS181 ALU with extended temperature range<BR>
in a cute caramic package.

<P>So I simply <B>could not resist</B> and did decide to buy them for building<BR>
a TTL CPU, while pushing all my transistor plans aside.

<P><I>Sorry to spoil your expectations...</I>
