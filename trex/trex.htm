| "No, we are not hard enough.",                        |

<P><B>TREX was an experimental 32 Bit TTL RISC CPU.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="trex_blinkenlight.jpg">

<HR>

<P>Back in 2006, I grouped up with a software guru...<BR>
and we did start this little project here...<BR>
<I>unfortunately, the project is dead now, the guru is gone,<BR>
(I fully understand that, and we parted as friends),<BR>
...and the PC with all the software tools and most of<BR>
the project files had a hard disk crash.</I><BR>
And as usual, there were no backups.

<HR>

<P>First we had some thoughts about using transistors, but during<BR>
my DECL transistor logic experiments, two things went obvious:

<P><B>First:</B> Building reliable transistorised DECL gates turned
out to be <BR>more difficult as I thought, same thing for <I>distributing</I>
the signals.

<P><B>Second:</B> It turned out to be hard to estimate the size of the CPU
<BR>(or the number of transistors).

<HR>
<P>Then I did stumble over some very cute 54LS181 ICs in a hobby shop,<BR>
and I could... not... resist.

<HR>

<P>Unfortunately, the control circuitry of the CPU never ran out of bugs,<BR>
and there was a day, when debugging it felt like visiting planet Klendathu.

<P>And while debugging the CPU, I bumped into a burnout at my workplace<BR>
back in August 2008, what separated me from hobby electronics for a very<BR>
long time.

<P>There is a random collection of some of the remaining (hardware related) files,<BR>
but please note that this stuff is unfinished, untested, and contains bugs.<BR>
<B>Thou shalt not try rebuilding it.</B>

<P><A HREF="trex.zip">trex.zip</A>

<P>Now the pictures:

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="trex_io.jpg">

<P><B>Peripheral/IO PCB.</B>

<P>Three modules can be plugged on top, and three modules at the bottom.<BR>
Currently, we have a timer, a PC keyboard interface, and a TTL UART.

<P>The timer had some minor bugs, but they are fixed in the new PCB layout.

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="trex_ecf.jpg">

<P><B>Ethernet and CompactFlash.</B>

<P>It would have been interesting to build a TTL based Ethernet controller,<BR>
but because it would have had only 10 MBit (and we already had enough other<BR>
important work to do), we decided against it.

<P>Unfortunately, the DM9000 went out of production, and we had to modify<BR>
our design a little bit to go with the DM9010.

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="trex_mem.jpg">

<P><B>Memory PCB.</B>

<P>Note the little module plugged on top of the PCB.<BR>
It's a 4 layer PCB, with 8 SRAMS (512 kB each) on top, and 8 SRAMs at the<BR>
bottom. It's possible to plug up to 16 such modules into the big PCB,<BR>
which means two stacks (4 modules each) on top of the big PCB,<BR>
and 4 modules at the bottom.

<P>Since one module carries 16 RAMs 512 kB each, the module has 8 MB RAM,<BR>
and the big PCB would be able to carry 128 MB of 15 ns SRAM in total.<BR>
Enough for running serious software...

<P>Note: when defining one layer of a multilayer PCB as GND, make sure<BR>
that the PCB manufacturer _really_ knows about this,<BR>
else use GND polygons in the PCB layout.

<P>The design also contains PCB space for four 3.3V regulators,<BR>
just in case that 5V SRAMs might go out of production.

<HR>

<P><B>Now for the CPU.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="trex_cpu_top.jpg">
<P><IMG SRC="trex_cpu_bot.jpg">
<P><IMG SRC="trex_cpu_side1.jpg">
<P><IMG SRC="trex_cpu_side2.jpg">

<P>Some pictures from top, bottom, and the side.

<P>The CPU is a neat, compact "sandwich".<BR>
The big PCB in the middle of said "sandwich" contains the bus interface<BR>
and the status register.<BR>

<P><IMG SRC="trex_cpu_mtop.jpg">
<P><IMG SRC="trex_cpu_mbot.jpg">

<P>A closer view of the big PCB, note the "high density" connectors.<BR>
Three smaller PCBs are plugged into this big PCB:

<P><IMG SRC="trex_tcu.jpg">

<P>The control PCB with the instruction latch/decoder/sequencer has 4 layers,<BR>
and contains quite a few GALs.

<P>The other two PCBs carry 7 registers (biport register file built with 74574),<BR>
a shifter, and a 74181 based ALU.

<P><IMG SRC="trex_tpu.jpg">

<P>Since each of the two identical PCBs/modules carries ALU and registers<BR>
for only 16 Bit, two modules are required for a 32 Bit CPU.<BR>
Note the ICs on top and at the bottom of the PCB.<BR>
Yep, 37 ICs in total (four of them DIP24) on a two layer PCB. :-)

<P>The hard_to_buy 74182 can be replaced by a GAL if necessary.

<HR>

<P>The "TTAP port" of the CPU can be connected to the LPT port of a PC,<BR>
basically it's sort of a simplified JTAG interface, so it's possible to<BR>
start/stop/single_step a program, to execute an instruction sent by the<BR>
PC, and to read/write CPU registers...<BR>
which makes it possible to read/write CPU memory.

<P>Here a screenshot of a test program, doing an unsigned 32 * 32 Bit<BR>
multiplication with a 64 Bit result.<BR>
So 0xffffffff * 0xffffffff = 0xfffffffe00000001, and the program worked.

<P><IMG SRC="trex_mult.jpg">

<HR>

<P><I>So much for watching the remains of dead/extinct fossiles.</I><BR>
Rest in peace, my cute little dinosaur...

<P>
Looking at those pictures on a page in the internet is one thing.<BR>
But entering your workshop after a full year of absence, cleaning<BR>
up the desk from all those dead dinosaur guts is something<BR>
completely different.

<P>
Because when you take all those PCBs in your hands again,<BR>
you suddenly remember how much time and effort, how much<BR>
sweat and tears went into a project which seemed to be<BR>
doomed from the start...

<P><B>
And the thought that you wasted years of your life on<BR>
something like this can take it out of you.</B>
