<P>Three resistors, and a 74HC/AC CMOS gate.<BR>
<I>(All resistors have the same value.)</I>

<HR>

<P><B>From now on, we suppose that our logic gates<BR>
are powered with 5V.</B>

<P><I>For the input of a logic gate, treshold voltage is<BR>
what "separates" the LOW from the HIGH.</I>

<P>While TTL compatible logic (74LS/ALS/F/HCT/ACT)<BR>
has a treshold voltage of ca. <B>1.3 V</B>,<BR> 
CMOS compatible logic (40xx, 74HC/AC)<BR>
has a treshold voltage of half the supply voltage,<BR>
<B>what means 2.5 V.</B>

<P>I'm leaving out quite a few little details here,<BR>
but to be on the safe side, apply to the input<BR>
of a CMOS gate:

<P><I>for logic HIGH</I> more than ca. <B>3.33 V</B><BR>
(more than two third of the supply voltage).

<P><I>for logic LOW</I> less than ca. <B>1.67 V</B><BR>
(less than one third of the supply voltage).

<HR>

<P><B>Warning:</B> logic gates with bipolar output<BR>
transistors (74LS/ALS/F) don't give out the full<BR>
supply voltage, so don't use them to drive those<BR>
resistors.

Let's suppose, that we use 74HC/HCT/AC/ACT<BR>
outputs to drive the resistors at the A,B or C <BR>
input of our majority gate with either<BR>
(nearly) <B>0V</B>, or (nearly) <B>5V</B>.

<P><I>(We now ignore the low input current of the<BR>
CMOS gate, and the voltage drop at the MOS<BR>
output transistors when sending current<BR>
through them.)</I>

<P>If all inputs of our majority gate have the same<BR>
logic level, it's easy:

<P><IMG SRC="a4_maj_eq.png">

<HR>

<P>If two inputs are LOW and one input is HIGH,<BR>
our resistors form up a voltage divider:

<P><IMG SRC="a4_maj_hll.png">

<P>And through our voltage divider, there will flow<BR>
a current of <B>I = 5V / (1.5 * R)</B>

<P>For instance, if R = 470 Ohm, I = 7.1 mA.

<P>At the input of our CMOS gate, we would have<BR>
a voltage of (0.5 * R) * I = 1.67 V...<BR>
in other words, one third of the supply voltage.

<HR>

<P>If one input is low and two inputs are high,<BR>
we would have exactly the same current as in the<BR>
previous example.

<P><IMG SRC="a4_maj_hhl.png">

<P>Except that the voltage at the input of the<BR>
CMOS gate would be R * I = 3.33 V...<BR>
two third of the supply voltage.

<HR>

<P>So much for theory.<BR>
<B>Warning:</B> to be on the safe side, the current you<BR>
sink/source with a 74HC/HCT/AC/ACT better<BR>
should be less than 7.8 mA,<BR>
<B>so you better use resistors with more than 470 Ohm.</B>
