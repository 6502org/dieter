<P>Imagine, you have a homebuilt rocket...<BR>
or a homebuilt reactor, as the one thing<BR>
doesn't necessarily exclude the other.

<P><IMG SRC="a4_projectpluto.jpg">

<P>To control your new toy, you need a computer.<BR>
And that's where trouble starts.

<P>Imagine, that your little computer is getting<BR>
the hickups, maybe due to heat, to radiation,<BR>
or to a cute little software bug.

<P>The result may burn an enormous amount of money,<BR>
and/or an enormous amount of Earth's surface.

<P><IMG SRC="a4_kawumm.jpg">

<P>To be on the safe side, engineers soon had the idea<BR>
of integrating three computers into their dangerous toy<BR>
<I>(preferably computers with different hardware and<BR>
software, if there was enough time and money<BR>
available for their project).</I>

<P>The basic idea was, that one computer might fail,<BR>
but that two computers won't fail at the same time.

<P>So the computers always did a vote:<BR>
if the <B>majority</B> of the computers said<BR>
"up with the rocket" or "up with the control rods",<BR>
something went into motion.

<P>If the majority of the computers said "do nothing",<BR>
nothing happened.

<P>Now for our majority gate, which connects those<BR>
three computers <U>A</U>lpha, <U>B</U>eta and <U>C</U>harly to the<BR>
servo motor <U>Q</U>ueer:

<P><IMG SRC="a4_maj1.png">

<P>When using standard logic gates to build such a<BR>
majority gate, it will look like this:

<P><IMG SRC="a4_majgate.png">

<P>But there is another approach...
