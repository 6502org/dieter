<P>(100 ns / 5 V div.)

<P><I>Another planet conquered by Spaceman Spiff.</I>

<HR>

<P>Now to describe the test setup:<BR>
A 16 MHz oscillator clocks a 74163 binary counter.<BR>
The three counter outputs QA, QB and QC are fed<BR>
to the resistors of our majority gate.

<P>Because I only had a 74LS163 in the drawer, a<BR>
74HCT245 had to be placed in between to have<BR>
the correct logic levels for the inputs A, B, C<BR>
of our majority gate.

<P><B>There are resistor networks available in a<BR>
5 pin SIL package, which contain 4 resistors.</B><BR>
For this test, I didn't solder them directly into<BR>
the PCB, but plugged them into a precision<BR>
DIP socket instead.

<P>The only 74HC IC I had in the drawer was a<BR>
74HC32, so it became a part of my contraption.

<HR>

<P><B>Warning:</B><BR>
Be aware, that a CMOS logic gate has an input<BR>
capacitance of up to 10 pF, and when placing a<BR>
resistor in front of the input of said gate,<BR>
the resistor and the capacitor will form up<BR>
<B>a low pass filter.</B>

<P>Now some pictures, of what the signal at the<BR>
input of the CMOS gate may look like for<BR>
different resistor values.

<P><I>Note, that I hooked a passive 10:1 probe to the<BR>
input of the gate, which probably had a 20 pF<BR>
input capacitance...<BR>
so the signals may be better than shown<BR>
in the pictures.</I>

<P>470 Ohm resistors: a very nice signal.<BR>
(100 ns / 1 V div.)

<P><IMG SRC="a4_maj_470.jpg">
<HR>

<P>1 kOhm resistors still would be ok...
<P><IMG SRC="a4_maj_1k.jpg">
<HR>

<P>2.2 kOhm resistors:
<P><IMG SRC="a4_maj_2k2.jpg">
<HR>

<P>But at 4.7 kOhm, the signal stops looking nice.
<P><IMG SRC="a4_maj_4k7.jpg">
<HR>

<P>Propagation delay of such a 74HC32 based<BR>
majority gate for different resistor values:

<P><PRE>
470  Ohm -> 10 ns
1   kOhm -> 12 ns
2.2 kOhm -> 16 ns
4.7 kOhm -> 22 ns
</PRE>

<HR>

<P>If you build a majority gate that way, it is highly<BR>
recommended that you study the datasheets of<BR>
the ICs first.<BR>
And always be aware about the current you<BR>
sink/source with the outputs of the gates<BR>
which drive your majority gate...<BR>
especially when such an output has to drive<BR>
more than one majority gate input.

<P>Place your resistors as close to the CMOS<BR>
gate input as possible, and try to go with<BR>
resistor values between<BR>
<B>470 Ohm and 4.7 kOhm.</B>

<HR>

<P>Our example showed a 74HC32 two input OR<BR>
logic gate, but it also should work with logic gates<BR>
which have more than two inputs...<BR>
with multiplexers...<BR>
with 74HC245 buffers...<BR>
<B>But not with Schmitt triggers, of course.</B>

<HR>

<P>Now for the boring part of the story.
