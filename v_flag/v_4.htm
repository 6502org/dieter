<P>The previous example is nice when using an adder, like the 74283.<BR>
Problem is, that with ALU chips like the 74181, we don't have access to B'.

<P><I>So we have to build our own B'.</I><BR>
For A+B, we could use the previous example.<BR>
For B-A, we have to invert A7.<BR>
For A-B, we have to invert B7.

<P>I'm aware, that using colours in an article could look like a sign of
incompetence.<BR>
But it's only to mark/emphasize the three different modes of operation.

<P>Well, we would need six 4_Input_ANDs, one 6_Input_OR, and three inverters.
<BR>Could be done with 3*7420, 1*7430, and 0.5*7404.

<P>Fortunately, the 74151 features a nice AND/OR_combination,<BR>
that could be used to solve our problem.<BR>
We have three enable_lines, called A+B, B-A, A-B in that example,<BR>
only one of them could be active at a time.

<P><I>You sure mentioned the numbers in the AND gates.<BR>
Please compare them to the 74151_Inputs in this schematic:</I>

<P>Now for the 74181.<BR>
There is no B-A.

<P>Signals at the 74181 control lines (A,B high_active):<BR>
<PRE>
A+B: S3..0 = 1001
A-B: S3..0 = 0110
</PRE>

<P>So we take S0 for indicating A+B, and S1 for indicating A-B.

<P>That's all for now.<P>
