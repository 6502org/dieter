<P>Addressing modes with postincrement/predecrement<BR>
may simplify stack operations.

<P>An option to push a register on stack, after incrementing<BR>
PC to the next instruction, and before loading the register<BR>
with a new value, could also give a nice rts instruction.

<P><I>Although, a dedicated SP (StackPointer) register inside<BR>
the CPU instead would be a better thing.</I>

<HR>
<P>Two index registers (like X,Y) would be nice.<BR>
Also an addressing mode like <B>(IND),Y</B> as with the 6502 to<BR>
simplify things like building a screen editor.

<HR>
<P>With more registers and addressing modes, the instruction set<BR>
encoding will have to change.<BR>
But then, the old concept would require more than 16 Bits.

<P>Another idea would be using two levels of encoding.<BR>
Means, some sort of "PALs/GALs", that decode a more CISC_like<BR>
16 Bit Opcode into, lets say, a MT15_like format...<BR>
just with more Bits.<P>

<HR>
<P>Some of the things mentioned in here may be useful for you,<BR>
when designing your own instruction set, and some may not.

<P>Dissecting machine code, generated from compilers out of C_sourcecode,<BR>
may also be a help to make up your decision.<BR>
<I>Be warned, that your relationship to some popular microcontrollers<BR>
may become "strained" from any attempts of doing so.</I>

<P>But, of course, you're still on your own when inventing an instruction<BR>
set for your hobby CPU.

<P>That's all for now.
