<P>Thanks to Beregnyei Balazs for his reverse_engineering attempts.

<P>(Open_collector/open_drain output inverters can be used<BR>
to build NOR_gates.)

<P>The input_multiplexers look as described two pages ago,<BR>
so I didn't draw them again.<BR>
What we called A is the special bus (SB), a bidirectional bus<BR>
that is used to read/write registers.<BR>
B would be the internal data bus (DB), it's mostly used<BR>
to read the external data bus through the data input latch.<BR>
The ALU output can connect through switches to the special bus,<BR>
and to the internal address bus A7..0.<BR>
(There are additional switches between special bus and internal<BR>
address bus A15..A8.<BR>
The ALU output also feds the BCD_correction_circuitry,<BR>
to write into the accumulator.

<P>Note, that in the 6502 the pullup_resistors we had<BR>
at the ALU_inputs seem to be MOS transistors working<BR>
as current source during PHI2=1.

<P>That's all for now.<BR>
