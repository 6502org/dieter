| Processor design is like theater.                  |
| When you are responsible for the requisites,       |
| no one from the audience wants to hear your story, |
| how fake knives etc. actually work.                |
|                                                    |
| They want to keep the illusion from the things     |
| performed on stage ...except when they happen      |
| to have the same job as you, but chances for       |
| that are low, because they won't like going        |
| into theaters then.                                |

<P>It's been a year since I wrote some text about ALU design.
<P>Decided to write together, what I learned since then.
