<P>For a detailed list of 74181 operations, please consult the 74LS181/
74S181 datasheet.<BR>
(In all examples mentioned here: high_active A,B,F and low_active
carry at the 74181 I/O_pins)<BR>
For convenience, we call the F_outputs Q, like in all other ALU examples.


<P><IMG SRC="a2_74181a.png">

<P>Basically, it works a bit like the first version of my multiplexer_ALU<BR>
mentioned in the previous article.

<P><B>Q=A+B:</B><I> S3..0 = 1001</I><BR>
The blue marked ANDs are active, so that !P=!(A|B) and !G=!(A&B).<BR>
To make it short, a NOR for !P and a NAND for !G, like in the 74283.<BR>
The first XOR emits 0, wenn !P=!G.<BR>
Means, it emits 1, when !P is active, and !G is inactive...<BR>
so we have the first half adder.<BR>
Now the second XOR as the other half_adder, adding the Carry.<BR>
It's easy.

<P><B>Q=A-B:</B><I> S3..0 = 0110</I><BR>
The red marked ANDs are active.<BR>
Basically it's like A+B, with B inverted.<BR>
Note: borrow is low_active, like with the 6502.

<P><B>Q=A+1:</B><I> S3..0 = 0000</I><BR>
Generate is inactive. Propagate is A. ALU output is A+Carry_input.<BR>
All we have to do is to force the Carry_input to active.

<P><B>Q=A-1:</B><I> S3..0 = 1111</I><BR>
When enabling the red and blue marked ANDs, we have A+(B|!B),<BR>
what is identical to A+1.<BR>
The ALU will perform an addition, acting like all B_Inputs would be 1.<BR>
What would be the same as adding -1, or decrementing.

<P><B>Q=A+A:</B><I> S3..0 = 1100</I><BR>
Both generate_ANDs are active, so the B_signals will be eliminated<BR>
(because !B|B=1), setting the propagate and generate signals to A.<BR>
To make it short, we are adding A with A, what is identical<BR>
to shifting A left.


<P><B>Note: 74181 can't shift right.</B>
