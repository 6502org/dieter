<P><B>The 74283, a well known adder:</B>
<P><IMG SRC="a2_74283.png">

<HR>
<P><B>The less known 8260 from Signetics.</B><BR>
Some kind of ALU chip, with a minimalistic functionality:<BR>
addition, XNOR, AND.
<P><IMG SRC="a2_8260.png">

<P>The 8260 had 2 control_lines, called C_INH and E_INH.<BR>
C_INH was used to select arithmetic or logic operation mode.<BR>
<I>C_INH=0</I> enabled the carry chain, and the 8260 worked as an adder.<BR>
<I>C_INH=1</I> disabled the carry chain by forcing all it's high_active<BR>
carry outputs to 1, what basically turned the XOR gate into an inverter.

<P>When logic mode was selected, E_INH was used to force the<BR>
propagate_signals active, what made it possible to switch<BR>
from XNOR to AND.

<P><B>The 74181 ALU:</B><BR>
A marvel of logic design.
<P><IMG SRC="a2_74181.png">

<P>It also has a control line, called <B>M</B>, to select<BR>
arithmetic or logic operation mode.

<P>In logic mode, the carry chain is disabled, and the<BR>
high_active carry_outputs are forced to 1.<BR>
(In all examples mentioned here: high_active A,B,F and<BR>
low_active carry at the 74181 I/O_pins)<BR>
Like with the 8260, this turns the XOR at the output into an inverter.

<P>Now to discuss how it works in detail.
