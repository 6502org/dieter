<P>We travelled far through the land of bipolar logic design.<BR>
But modern microprocessors use MOS transistors.

<P>MOS field effect transistors have a very low input current,<BR>
and it's possible to build nifty switches<BR>
(as known from analog sample & hold amplifiers).<BR>
You could use 74HCT4066 for experimenting.

<P>Now to describe, what one Bit of ALU in a microprocessor<BR>
could look like:

<P><IMG SRC="a2_mosalu.png">

<P>A,B are the two ALU_input busses.<BR>
If no register connects to a bus, the bus is set to -1<BR>
(all Bits high) by the pullup_resistors.<P>

<P>What means, for decrementing A:<BR>
No register is connected to B, so B=-1.<BR>
We are passing A,B through to A',B'.<BR>
Then we close the ADD switch at the ALU output.

<P>For incrementing A, we turn B' to 0,<BR>
force the carry_input active,<BR>
and perform an addition.

<P>For A-B, we only have to invert B, so that B'=!B.<BR>
The rest works like with A+B.

<P>For shifting A one Bit left, no register connects to B,<BR>
and the SHL switch in front of the ALU is closed.<BR>
When A'=A and B'=A, all left to do is selecting ADD.<BR>
(Note, that two pullup resistors are now switched in parallel).

<P>For shifting A one Bit right, no register connects to B.<BR>
The pullup_resistors will turn all Bits on B to 1,<BR>
so the generate_signal is set to A.<BR>
The SHR switch connects the generate_signal<BR>
to the next lower ALU_output.

<P>Because we are using MOS transistors,<BR>
we have another nice additional gimmick:<BR>
The switches have a high impedance, when open.<BR>
Logic gates with MOS transistors have a high input impedance.<BR>
What means, when disconnecting A' from A (or B' from B),<BR>
the input capacitance of the AND/OR gates (that produce<BR>
the propagate/generate signals) can be used to build up<BR>
a transparent latch, holding the logic level for a few<BR>
microseconds.<BR>
In other words: with that ALU design, we are getting<BR>
a transparent latch (like 74373) between A, A' and B, B'<BR>
for free.
